AUTO-SAVING FUNCTIONALITY TEST CHECKLIST:

1. TEST: Adding new exercises should trigger auto-save
   - Create a new workout
   - Add an exercise
   - Minimize the app or switch to background
   - Restore the workout
   - VERIFY: Exercise should be present

2. TEST: Adding new sets should trigger auto-save
   - Open an existing workout with exercises
   - Add a new set to an exercise
   - Minimize the app
   - Restore the workout
   - VERIFY: New set should be present

3. TEST: Updating weight/reps should trigger auto-save
   - Open a workout with sets
   - Enter weight and reps values
   - Minimize the app WITHOUT completing the set
   - Restore the workout
   - VERIFY: Weight and reps values should be preserved

4. TEST: Completing sets should trigger auto-save
   - Open a workout with sets
   - Complete a set (toggle completion)
   - Minimize the app
   - Restore the workout
   - VERIFY: Set completion status should be preserved

5. TEST: Rest timer state should be preserved
   - Complete a set to start rest timer
   - Minimize the app while timer is running
   - Restore the workout
   - VERIFY: Rest timer should continue from correct time

6. TEST: Weight/reps data should not be lost during restoration
   - Enter weight and reps values
   - Minimize and restore multiple times
   - VERIFY: Values should persist across all restorations

7. TEST: Periodic auto-save should work (every 30 seconds)
   - Start a workout with timer running
   - Make changes (add exercises, sets, update values)
   - Wait 30+ seconds
   - Force close app and restart
   - VERIFY: Changes should be preserved

8. TEST: No data loss on app backgrounding
   - Have an active workout with data
   - Put app in background for extended time
   - Return to foreground
   - VERIFY: All data should be intact

ðŸ”¥ NEW: 9. TEST: Complete app restart recovery (DATABASE PERSISTENCE)
   - Start a workout and add exercises/sets
   - Enter weight and reps values
   - Force close the app completely
   - Restart the app
   - Open the same workout
   - VERIFY: All data should be restored exactly as it was

ðŸ”¥ NEW: 10. TEST: Device reboot recovery
   - Start a workout with active timer
   - Add data and make changes
   - Reboot the device
   - Restart the app
   - VERIFY: Workout state should be fully restored

ISSUES FIXED:

âœ… Added auto-save calls to _addSetToExercise()
âœ… Added auto-save calls to _updateSetData()
âœ… Added auto-save calls to _updateSetComplete()
âœ… Added auto-save calls to _addExercise()
âœ… Fixed controller data persistence in _updateExerciseDataFromControllers()
âœ… Added controller initialization after workout loading
âœ… Optimized foreground service calls to reduce redundancy
âœ… Fixed recursive call issue in _updateExerciseDataFromControllers()
âœ… CRITICAL FIX: Added persistent database storage for workout states
âœ… Added automatic restoration from database on app restart
âœ… Added active workout session management with proper cleanup

NEW FEATURES ADDED:

ðŸ†• PERSISTENT WORKOUT STATE STORAGE:
   - Created active_workout_sessions table in database
   - All workout progress now saved to database immediately
   - Survives complete app restarts (not just minimization)
   - Automatic session cleanup when workouts are completed/discarded

ðŸ†• DATABASE-BACKED AUTO-RECOVERY:
   - App checks for active sessions on startup
   - Automatically restores workout state from database
   - Preserves timer state, weight/reps values, rest timers
   - Works across device reboots and app force-closes

ðŸ†• SESSION LIFECYCLE MANAGEMENT:
   - Active sessions created when workout timer starts
   - Sessions updated on every auto-save trigger
   - Sessions cleared when workouts are completed or discarded
   - Only one active session allowed at a time

TESTING METHODOLOGY:

To test these features manually:
1. Build and run the app
2. Create or open a workout
3. Follow each test case above
4. Pay special attention to weight/reps values preservation
5. Test both temporary and permanent workouts
6. Test both app minimization and backgrounding scenarios

EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:

- All workout data should auto-save immediately when:
  * Adding exercises
  * Adding sets
  * Updating weight/reps values
  * Completing sets
  * Every 30 seconds during active workout
  * ðŸ†• EVERY SAVE NOW PERSISTS TO DATABASE

- Weight and reps values should:
  * Persist across app minimization/restoration
  * Show correctly in text fields after restoration
  * Be saved to database/temp storage immediately
  * ðŸ†• SURVIVE COMPLETE APP RESTARTS

- Rest timer should:
  * Continue accurately across app state changes
  * Resume with correct remaining time
  * Play sound when completed even if app was backgrounded
  * ðŸ†• RESTORE CORRECTLY AFTER APP RESTART

- No data should be lost during:
  * App backgrounding
  * App minimization
  * Hot restarts (development)
  * Normal app lifecycle transitions
  * ðŸ†• COMPLETE APP RESTARTS
  * ðŸ†• DEVICE REBOOTS
  * ðŸ†• APP FORCE-CLOSES

ðŸ”¥ CRITICAL IMPROVEMENT:
The app now uses DATABASE PERSISTENCE instead of just in-memory storage.
This means ALL workout progress is automatically saved to the device's 
database and will survive any type of app interruption or restart.
