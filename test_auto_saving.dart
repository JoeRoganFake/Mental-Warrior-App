// AUTO-SAVE FUNCTIONALITY - FINAL IMPLEMENTATION ✅
// This file documents the complete auto-save system for workout progress tracking

/*
🚀 IMPLEMENTED FEATURES:

1. ⏰ AUTO-SAVE TIMER (NEW - EVERY 10 SECONDS)
   - Dedicated timer that saves workout state every 10 seconds
   - Starts automatically when workout timer begins  
   - Stops automatically when workout ends or app disposes
   - Independent of the main workout timer for reliability

2. 📊 COMPREHENSIVE DEBUG LOGGING
   Each auto-save prints detailed information:
   - Unique workout ID with timestamp for tracking
   - Current timestamp in ISO format
   - Total workout duration (formatted as MM:SS)
   - Complete list of exercises in the workout
   - Sets progress (completed sets / total sets)
   - Rest timer status (time remaining, set ID, running/paused state)

3. 💾 PERSISTENT DATABASE STORAGE
   - Uses WorkoutService.updateActiveWorkoutSession() for database persistence
   - Updates activeWorkoutNotifier for in-memory tracking
   - Creates active_workout_sessions table entries
   - Ensures workout survives app kill/restart/reboot

4. 🔄 SEAMLESS INTEGRATION
   - Works with existing minimization/maximization system
   - Preserves rest timer states across app transitions
   - Maintains exercise and set data integrity
   - Compatible with foreground service functionality

SAMPLE DEBUG OUTPUT:
💾 AUTO-SAVE #3
   Workout ID: workout_-1755178929686_1734191238123
   Timestamp: 2024-12-14T15:23:18.456Z
   Duration: 05:00
   Exercises (3): Push-ups, Squats, Bench Press
   Sets Progress: 8/12 completed
   Rest Timer: 01:15 remaining (Set ID: 12457) [RUNNING]
   ─────────────────────────────────────────

🧪 TEST SCENARIOS:

1. Basic Auto-Save Test:
   - Start workout → Watch for auto-save messages every 10 seconds
   - Add exercises → Verify they appear in next auto-save log
   - Complete sets → Check sets progress updates

2. Rest Timer Persistence:
   - Complete a set to start rest timer
   - Kill app while timer is running
   - Restart app → Timer should continue from correct time

3. Complete State Recovery:
   - Start workout, add exercises, enter weights/reps
   - Force close app
   - Restart app → All data should be exactly restored

4. Background/Foreground Cycle:
   - Active workout with timer running
   - Put app in background for 2+ minutes
   - Return to foreground → Timer and data should be accurate

5. Device Reboot Test:
   - Start workout with significant progress
   - Reboot device
   - Restart app → Workout should restore completely

✅ VERIFICATION CHECKLIST:

□ Auto-save messages appear every 10 seconds during active workout
□ Workout ID is unique and contains timestamp
□ Exercise list is accurate and updates when exercises added
□ Sets progress shows correct completed/total ratio
□ Rest timer state (if active) shows time, set ID, and pause status
□ All data persists across app kill/restart
□ Timer continues accurately after restoration
□ No memory leaks (auto-save timer stops properly)

🎯 KEY IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:

Files Modified:
- lib/pages/workout/workout_session_page.dart

Methods Added:
- _startAutoSaveTimer() - Starts 10-second periodic timer
- _stopAutoSaveTimer() - Stops and cleans up timer
- _autoSaveWorkoutState() - Performs save with debug logging

Integration Points:
- _startTimer() - Calls _startAutoSaveTimer()
- _stopTimer() - Calls _stopAutoSaveTimer()  
- dispose() - Cancels _autoSaveTimer to prevent leaks

Storage Method:
- WorkoutService.updateActiveWorkoutSession() for database
- WorkoutService.activeWorkoutNotifier for memory
- Serialized workout data includes all exercise/set states

🔍 MONITORING:

To verify the system is working:
1. Start a workout and watch console output
2. Look for "💾 AUTO-SAVE #X" messages every 10 seconds
3. Verify workout data accuracy in the debug output
4. Test app kill/restart scenarios to confirm persistence

The auto-save system provides comprehensive workout progress protection
and detailed logging for debugging and verification purposes.
